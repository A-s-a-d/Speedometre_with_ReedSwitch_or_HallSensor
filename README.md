# Speedometre_with_ReedSwitch_or_HallSensor
CREATE A SPEEDOMETER FOR A REMOTE CONTROL CAR.

SENSOR USED = REEDSWITCH  OR HALLSENSOR .

A MAGNET IS PLACED ON THE WHEEL AND THE SENSOR IS FIXED ON THE FRAME WHERE IT CAN DETECT THE MAGNET.

IT IS NECESSARY TO MEASURE THE RADIUS OF THE WHEEL THEN CALCULATE THE PERIMETER TO CALCULATE THE SPEED ACCORDING TO THE FREQUENCY OF ROTATION OF THE WHEEL.

FOR MY SPEEDOMETER I USED AN ARDUINO CARD, A SENSOR, A BATTERY TO POWER THE ARDUINO, A LOW FREQUENCY GENERATOR TO SIMULATE THE DETECTION OF MAGNET BY THE SENSOR TO VERIFY MY CODE.
